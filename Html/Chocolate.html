<b>Chocolate</b> or <b>cocoa</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food">food</a> made from roasted and ground <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_bean">cacao</a> seed kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own or as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavoring">flavoring agent</a> in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some form for at least 5,300 years starting with the <mark>Mayo-Chinchipe</mark> culture in what is present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador">Ecuador</a><sup>[1]</sup> and later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.<sup>[2]</sup>

The seeds of the <del>cacao tree</del> have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate_liquor">chocolate liquor</a>. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: <mark>cocoa solids and cocoa butter</mark>. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more fiber than cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce Dutch cocoa. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter, or added vegetable oils and sugar. <u>Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids</u>.
