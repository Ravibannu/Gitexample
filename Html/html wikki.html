<b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a>. It defines the content and structure of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content">web content</a>. It is often assisted by technologies such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> and scripting languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.

<u>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, <del>functional</del>, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</u>

The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.

Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a>, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
